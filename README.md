## Project Overview
- Use data analytics to analyse how and why users place their listings in New York City by performing borough and room type analysis and room name text analysis.
- The dataset can be obtained from [Airbnb open-source dataset website](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/).
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) is used to assist this project with data analytics by extracting important insights using: 
  - [Basic Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics)
  - [Data Visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_and_information_visualization)
  - [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis)
  - [Text Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Text_analysis&redirect=no)



## Motivation
- Airbnb is well-known for its primary principle of connecting people and cultures by offering a platform for residential space sharing.
- Visitors or tourists today are drawn to crowded places with stunning scenery, city activity, or a healthy environment.
- Because New York City is such a large and crowded state, it raises the question of which neighbourhood of New York City a person should rent in, and if so, what sort of room.
- Furthermore, if a person want to become an Airbnb host, what name convention should the host employ in order to attract more casual guests or travellers?



### Aim & Objective
- Aim: 
  - To analyze how new hosts can place their listings to generate more profit in New York City since they may have difficulty on where to place their listings in different boroughs, neighbourhoods, room type, and naming of the listings to attract more travelers easily.
- Objective: 
    - To analyze what can be learned about the various boroughs and room types through borough and room type analysis.
    - Perform text mining on the content of the room naming convention and try to determine the aspects that contribute to the outcome.
    - The insights gained from analysing the Airbnb listening data will be useful in deciding the elements to consider while listing on the Airbnb platform for new hosts and travellers.
